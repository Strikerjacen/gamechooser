Brief -
This Python program allows for the maintenance of a video game library.  It supports editing of multiple textfile-based databases of titles (addition, removal) as well as a random picker with which to select a set of titles from a database.
It checks duplicate titles and supports the addition of additional title information for organizational purposes.

Developer Notes -
I wrote this over my free time outside of school.  At the time, I was most familiar with coding in Python, due to my preference for writing code first in free hand outline and not worrying about symantics or cleanliness until later.
I realize that this could easily have been accomplished with less pains in a database-organized language, and I may revist that option in the future.
At the moment, this is just a rough early try at creating a text-editing list program with significant pains toward easy user instruction/interation.
Enjoy!
